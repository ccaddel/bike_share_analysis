# Bike Share Analysis

Bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We'll compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. We'll also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

## Process

Posing questions about the data along the way, I'll collect and wrangle the data before performing my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistics and visualizations, leading to **Conclusions** section.

## Workflow Setup

Create a Python environment in Jupyter Notebook with the following packages:

- csv
- datetime
- pprint
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Upload datasets:
    - New York City ([Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data))
    - Chicago ([Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data))
    - Washington D.C. ([Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data))
